Problem:

Given simulation data at two temperatures T_1 > T_2, determine if there is a critical temperature between T_1 and T_2. If yes, then find an order parameter describing the phase transition and identify which symmetries are broken.


Approach:

1. Run MCMC simulations at temperatures T_1 and T_2. Ensure ergodicity.

2. Assume we know the symmetry group G of the Hamiltonian. Let H be the subgroup of broken symmetries at T = 0; these are the only symmetries relevant to describing phase transitions.

To find H, run one MCMC chain at T = 0. If necessary, start at a positive temperature and gradually cool down to T = 0. The convergent distribution should consist of a single state-- the ground state. Let K be the subgroup of symmetries that fix the ground state; this should be easy to determine. Then H = G/K.

Note: For the 2D classical Ising model, G is the group of all translations, (90-degree) rotations, and reflections, along with a spin-flip symmetry. K is the subgroup of all translations, rotations, and reflections. H is then just the spin-flip symmetry (and the identity map).

Question: In general, can we guarantee that G/K is a group?

3. Use a DNN or any other parameterized family of functions to represent an observable-- a function acting on states. Enforce the group H so that the observable is H-equivariant. This ensures that the distribution of measurements of the observable respects the same symmetries as the Hamiltonian.

Per Landau theory, we are interested in the stable equilibrium values of the observable. These correspond to the modes of its measurement distribution (obtained by mapping the dataset of states through the observable function). Above the critical temperature when symmetries are unbroken, we expect the measurement distribution to be unimodal, with the mode itself invariant to the symmetries in H. Below the critical temperature when symmetries are broken, we expect the measurement distribution to be multimodal; the distribution as a whole still respects all of H, but each mode only respects a subgroup of H; the broken symmetries permute the modes.

4. Find the modes of the measurement distribution by fitting a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to the measurements. Use a special GMM with |H| components where the means of the components form the orbit of a single mean under the action of H.

Use two separate GMMs for the T_1 and T_2 datasets but a common observable function. For the GMM at T_1, set the mean of all components to 0. During training, this will constrain the observable to respect all symmetries (no broken symmetries) at the higher temperature.

5. Jointly optimize the observable function with the GMM by maximizing the data likelihood under this compositional model. Alternate between minibatches of the T_1 and T_2 datasets at each training iteration, and use the appropriate GMM corresponding to the dataset being used.

6. After training, look at the mean of one component of the GMM used with the T_2 dataset. This mean will be approximately invariant under the action of some subgroup of H. This subgroup is the group of unbroken symmetries. If all the GMM components have collapsed to a single mean (mean 0), then all symmetries remain unbroken.
